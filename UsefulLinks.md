# Here are some links #

I found all these resources very helpful whilst working on the Playback Lib, specifically links relating to b-splines, about which I knew very little.

Thanks to all the authors.

**Notes of re-parameterising w.r.t. arc length (worked around this in the end, but may be desirable in the future)**
